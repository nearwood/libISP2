# libISP2
A library designed to provide easy communication with a device sending data via the Innovate Serial Protocol version 2. This library is currently read-only.

libISP2 provides the function ISP2::isp2_read. The first argument is a file descriptor, the second is an isp2_t struct. It will attempt to parse one packet from the given file descriptor into the given struct. If successful, ISP2::isp2_read will return 0. If ISP2::isp2_read cannot find a header, it will retun -1.

Until I write more better documentation, please have a look at isp2.h for information about the isp2_t struct.

## Installation
INSTALL contains modified generic GNU install instructions.
You must do `./autogen.sh` first
This is made to be a shared library, so under Linux you need to do `sudo ldconfig` after 'sudo make install`
